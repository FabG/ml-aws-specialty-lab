# Implementation and Operation Lab

### Use Case
In last Lab, we did some hyperparameter tuning.
Now we are ready to deploy this model into production.

Mr. K wants has given us the go to deploy the optimized Linear Learner model in production.
Once this is complete, Mk R's team can use it to investigate any newly reported UFO sighting.

Our goal is to deploy the model into prod and give Mr K's team some way to interact with the deployed model.



### Approach and Questions to answer
- Deploy our LinearLearner model using Sagemaker hosting
- Create a way to interact with the Sagemaker endpoint created for the deployed model.
- How will Mr K's team interact with the model? Will there be some type of user interface?
- What does the inout and output of the request look like? Will it be in batches or immediate response?
